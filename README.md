1. Self Introduction

Good morning! My name is Shreya Raundal, and I’ve completed my graduation in Computer Science and Design Engineering.

🔹 Tech Stack:
• Frontend: HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript for building responsive user interfaces.
• Programming Languages: Java (Core and Advanced).
• Frameworks & Libraries: Hibernate and JDBC for database connectivity and ORM.
• Database Management: MySQL and Oracle for data storage and query optimization.
• Tools: Postman for REST API testing and Git/GitHub for version control and collaboration.
• Core Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs), RESTful APIs, CRUD Operations, and Exception Handling.

Some of my key projects include Secure Video Steganography System, NASA API Implementation, and an Employee Management System, where I implemented CRUD operations, REST APIs, and database integration.

My major project — Secure Video Steganography System — focuses on data hiding and secure sharing using a combination of Steganography, Cryptography (MD5 hashing), and Visual Secret Sharing (VSS).
It ensures multi-layered security, so even if one layer is breached, the data remains protected.

I contributed to the GUI design, steganography logic, and database connectivity, ensuring smooth and user-friendly operation.
We developed the project using the Iterative SDLC model, refining security features in each phase.

Apart from my technical skills, I’m always eager to learn new technologies and improve system efficiency.
I’m very excited about the opportunity at Accella, as it aligns with my goal to grow as a full-stack developer and contribute to innovative real-world projects.

💻 2. Project Explanation (When interviewer says: “Tell me about your project”)

My final year project is titled Secure Video Steganography System.
It’s a secure data-hiding and sharing platform that combines three key technologies — Steganography, Cryptography, and Visual Secret Sharing (VSS) — to ensure multi-layered security for sensitive information.

🔹 Steganography hides the data inside media files such as images, QR codes, or video frames.
🔹 Cryptography uses MD5 hashing to encrypt the hidden data.
🔹 Visual Secret Sharing splits the encrypted data into multiple shares — only by combining them can the secret be reconstructed.

So even if someone accesses one layer, they can’t retrieve the original message without all parts.

The system supports custom encoding/decoding, QR code hiding, and provides a Java-based GUI for easy use.
It’s built using Java (Eclipse IDE) and MySQL with JDBC.

I personally worked on implementing the steganography logic, designing the GUI, and connecting it with the database.

We followed the Iterative SDLC model, refining and testing features in multiple cycles to enhance security and reliability.

The main impact of this project is that it demonstrates how combining multiple security layers can make data protection much stronger and tamper-proof compared to traditional methods.

💬 3. Why do you want to join Accella?

I want to join Accella because it offers real development exposure using modern technologies, which aligns perfectly with my learning goals.
I’ve gone through your company’s projects and really appreciate how Accella focuses on quality solutions and innovation.

As a fresher developer, I’m looking for a place where I can apply my skills, learn from experienced mentors, and grow with a collaborative team — and Accella seems like the right environment for that.

💪 4. Strengths and Weaknesses

Strengths:

I’m a quick learner and very dedicated once I take up a task.
I have strong problem-solving skills and like to break complex problems into smaller parts.
I also communicate clearly and work well in teams, which helps me adapt easily.

Weakness:

I sometimes take extra time to make sure my work is perfect, which can slow me down a bit.
But I’m learning to balance quality with deadlines by setting small checkpoints to track my progress.

👥 5. Tell me about a time you worked in a team

During my final year project — Steganography System for Enhanced Security — I worked in a team of four where we divided tasks based on our strengths.
I handled the coding part, mainly encryption and image processing, while others focused on documentation and UI.

We initially faced issues integrating modules, so I suggested having short sync meetings every few days.
That improved communication and helped us finish the project smoothly.
It taught me that teamwork is not just about coding, but about coordination, communication, and accountability.

🎯 6. Where do you see yourself in 3–5 years?

In the next 3–5 years, I see myself as a skilled full-stack developer, taking ownership of end-to-end projects and mentoring junior developers.
I want to keep learning, contribute to impactful projects, and gradually grow into a role that involves both development and leadership responsibilities.

🚀 7. Why should we hire you?

You should hire me because I have the right mix of technical foundation, curiosity, and learning attitude.
I’m confident in my Java and DSA skills, and I’ve already built real-world projects like the Library Management System and Secure Steganography System.

I adapt quickly, enjoy solving challenges, and am eager to contribute to Accella’s projects from day one.
I believe I can grow fast and become a valuable asset to your team.
