# Important
Good morning! My name is Shreya Raundal, and I’ve completed my graduation in Computer Science and Design Engineering.

I have a strong interest in software development and have built several projects using Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.

Some of my key projects include Secure Video Steganography System, NASA API Implementation, and an Employee Management System, where I implemented CRUD operations, REST APIs, and database integration.

My major project — Secure Video Steganography System — focuses on data hiding and secure sharing using a combination of Steganography, Cryptography (MD5 hashing), and Visual Secret Sharing (VSS).
It provides multi-layered security, ensuring that even if one layer is breached, the data remains protected.

I contributed to the GUI design, steganography logic implementation, and database connectivity, ensuring smooth functionality and user-friendly operation.

The project was developed using the Iterative SDLC model, which helped us refine the security features in each phase.

Apart from my technical skills, I’m always eager to learn new technologies and improve system design and efficiency.

I’m very excited about the opportunity at Accella, as it aligns perfectly with my goal to grow as a full-stack developer and contribute to innovative, real-world projects.

Project Title: Secure Video Steganography System

Overview:
This project is a secure data-hiding and sharing platform that combines three powerful security technologies: Steganography, Cryptography, and Visual Secret Sharing (VSS). The main goal is to provide multi-layered security for sensitive information, ensuring that data remains confidential, tamper-proof, and can only be accessed by authorized users.

Key Features:

Multi-Layered Security:
Steganography hides data inside media files (like images, QR codes, or video frames).
Cryptography (MD5 hashing) encrypts the hidden data.
Visual Secret Sharing (VSS) splits the encrypted data into multiple “shares” so that only combining them reveals the secret.
Custom Encoding/Decoding:
Converts text into “meaningful sentences” for obfuscation, and decodes it back.
QR Code Hiding:
Supports hiding data inside QR codes for easy sharing.
User-Friendly Java GUI:
Simple interface for hiding and retrieving data.
Tech Stack:

Java (Eclipse IDE), MySQL (with JDBC connector), runs on Windows.
How it works (High-Level):

Data Input: User provides sensitive data to hide.
Encoding & Encryption: Data is encoded and encrypted.
Steganography: Encrypted data is hidden inside a media file (image, video frame, or QR code).
Secret Sharing: The media file can be split into multiple shares (using VSS) — only by combining these shares can the original secret be reconstructed.
Decoding & Retrieval: The authorized user combines shares, extracts the hidden data, and decrypts it to retrieve the original message.
Why is this secure?
Most systems use only encryption or only steganography, which have vulnerabilities. By combining multiple techniques, even if one layer is broken, the others still protect the data. For example, if someone finds the hidden file, they still need to decrypt it and combine all shares to access the original information.

Project Methodology:
Developed using the Iterative SDLC model, which allowed us to add features and refine security step-by-step.

Team & My Role:

Collaborated with a team of four.
Personally contributed to [describe your main contributions: e.g., implementing the GUI, writing the steganography logic, handling database connections, etc.].
Impact:
This project demonstrates how integrating multiple security approaches can make data protection much more robust and resilient to attacks.

Apart from technical skills, I’m passionate about learning new technologies and improving system design and efficiency.
I’m excited about the opportunity at Accella, as I believe it will allow me to grow as a developer while contributing to meaningful projects with real-world impact.
